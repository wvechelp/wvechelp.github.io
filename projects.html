								<p>Hydropower is a well-known and popular alternative to the burning of fossil fuels due to its simplicity and relatively low cost. 
									Unfortunately, these hydropower installations tend to have an impact on the environment. The HydroCORE project uses this notice 
									as a basis to perform its activities, while using the Paute river basin in Cuenca (Ecuador) as study area. To communicate the 
									findings, a project-specific website has been developed for <a href="https://wvechelp.github.io/HydroCORE/" target="_blank">
									HydroCORE</a>. </p>

								<p>The Scheldt river finds it origin in France and continues its path through Belgium and the Netherlands, where it connects to the North Sea.
									Tidal activity runs as deep as the city of Ghent, where sluices prevent further intrusion of the tide and help maintain a stable water level 
									within the city. The wide variety of activities around and within the Scheldt estuary basin affects the inherent characteristics of the river, 
									though multiple mitigation strategies are in place to (continue to) improve the functioning of the Scheldt estuary. Every six years, an extensive
									T-report brings the monitoring data of the past six years together and evaluates the condition of the Scheldt estuary against a set of predefined
									criteria. The latest version covers the period 2016-2021 (T2021) and is being written by HKV, Antea Group, Waardenburg Ecology, and Ghent University.
									More information can be found on the <a href="https://vnsc.eu/agenda-voor-de-toekomst/monitoring-evaluatie-en-rapportage/" target="_blank">website of VNSC</a>

								<p>The human brain is a complex structure and deviations can occur both at the structural and functional level. Deviations at the 
									functional level (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) tend to be diagnosed based on interviews and associated
									symptom scores. More objective techniques to diagnose patients are desired, one of which is the use of functional neuroimaging
									techniques (e.g., EEG, PET, fMRI). The temporal profile of these fMRI signals are unique, though expected to be consistent among
									subjects of the same patient group. These patterns can be assessed through an alternative representation of the data as a bipartite
									network (signal-subject) and cluster inference via <i>topic models</i>. The obtained results show that clustering of patients based
									on the fMRI signals is possible, but suggest that there is another factor that steers the clustering (i.e. the infered clusters did 
									not represent the known patient groups). More information of the project (available data, methodology, results) can be found in the

								<p>Freshwater systems experience ever-growing pressures due to an increasing world population, the rising globalisatio, 
									and a changing climate. In order to use land and water in a more efficient manner, one has to consider the protection 
									and development of valuable ecosystem services that society receives from nature. To steer and support this,
									correlative models were developed to delineate the optimal abiotic conditions of a water body for a selection of 
									aquatic macrophytes. Specific attention was given to cleaning of the available data, after which five important habitat 
									descriptors and the associated optimal conditions were inferred. For the selected macrophytes, temperature (> 17 °C),
									nitrate-nitrogen (between 0.5 mg∙L<sup>-1</sup> and 1.5 mg∙L<sup>-1</sup>), oxygen (between 4 mg∙L<sup>-1</sup> and 
									7 mg∙L<sup>-1</sup>), ammonium-nitrogen (between 0.3 mg∙L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.5 mg∙L<sup>-1</sup>) and pH (between 7 and 
									8.5) appeared to be most important. Obtaining these conditions improves the chance of survival and establishment of the 
									selected macrophytes, conditional to their introduction (natural or artificial). The models were supplemented with 
									experiments on the alien <i>Lemna minuta</i>, aiming to support the proactive and reactive management of alien invasive 
									macrophytes. More information of the project (available data, methodology, results) can be found in the

								<p>Global plastic production increases each year starting at an annual production of 1.7 million tonnes in 1950 up to 288 million 
									tonnes in 2012. At the same time, an increase in plastic presence in domestic waste has been noted, going from 0.4 % in 1960 
									to about 10 % nowadays. Plastics are easily produced and can be used for almost invisible applications, going from scrubbers 
									in personal care products to fibers in synthetic clothing. The majority of these plastics are small, with dimensions
									frequently lower than 5 mm and are consequently called microplastics. As such, domestic wastewater is polluted with small 
									plastics which are believed to flow through the sewage treatment plant (STP) without being retained. In order to be able to 
									describe the removal efficiency of a STP samples of the influent, effluent, overflow, thickened sludge, and skimmed layer were 
									collected. Based on these samples, a removal efficiency of 47 % was observed when comparing the effluent with the influent. More 
									information of the project (available data, methodology, results) can be found in the 
									<a href="https://lib.ugent.be/catalog/rug01:002166784" target="_blank">report</a>.
